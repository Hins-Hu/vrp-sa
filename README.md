# Optimal Routing for Semi-Autonomous Trucks with Budget Constraints


## Caveat
1. Examples 2 and 3 show the difference between a dense representation and a sparse representation.
2. Examples 4 and 5 varify the effect of the budget constraints.
3. Example 6 reaches the size of 100 nodes and 10 customers. 
4. Example 7 contains a solution for the generic VRP.
5. Example 9 (generic_vrp, exact-model, and reduced_layer) verify that the solver works
